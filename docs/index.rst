Welcome to Flask's documentation.  This documentation is divided in
different parts.  I would suggest to get started with the
:ref:`installation` and then heading over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
Besides the quickstart there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that
shows how to create a complete (albeit small) application with Flask.  If
you rather want to dive into all the internal parts of Flask, check out
the :ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
:ref:`patterns` section.

Flask also depends on two external libraries: the `Jinja2`_ template
engine and the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI toolkit.  both of which are not documented
here.  If you want to dive into their documentation check out the
following links:

-   `Jinja2 Documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/>`_
-   `Werkzeug Documentation <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/documentation/>`_
